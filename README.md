# Case Study: Cyclistic Bike Share

This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
This case consists of analyzing the information of a fictitious bicycle rental company. The scenario worked here is that the director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, it wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
From the insights, it will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## What's in here

1. Original Data

In the compressed files Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.zip and Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.zip you can find the original tables of information for the years 2019 and 2020 from a freely accessible and anonymized repository
   
2. Code Scripts

Files Code-SQL-Riders_2019.sql and Code-SQL-Riders_2020.sql contain the SQL code files executed in Google BigQuery and used in data analysis. In general terms, data tables were cleaned and prepared, as well as basic calculations were performed to obtain results for the analysis.

3. Visualization Results

Files Results_Rides_2019.pdf and Results_Rides_2020.pdf contain visualizations of the results obtained later. These were created in Microsoft Power BI, and given the characteristics of the account with which they were created, it was only possible to export them in PDF format. However, the visualizations show the results necessary for better decision making for the case study.

4. Data Journal

Finally, there is the data journal, THIS IS IN SPANISH, which shows the step-by-step analysis carried out and the measures taken for the analysis and the reasons for them. It also shows the main conclusions and suggestions that were reached from this analysis.
